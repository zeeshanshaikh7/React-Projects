Here is a `README.md` file text for my React Password Generator application:

# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator application built with React. It allows you to generate a random password based on specified criteria such as length, inclusion of numbers, and special characters. You can also copy the generated password to the clipboard.

## Features

- **Password Length:** Adjust the length of the password using a range slider (8 to 20 characters).
- **Include Numbers:** Toggle the inclusion of numeric characters.
- **Include Special Characters:** Toggle the inclusion of special characters.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single click.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zeeshanshaikh7/password-generator.git
   cd password-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage

1. **Adjust Password Length:**
   - Use the range slider to set the desired password length (between 8 and 20 characters).

2. **Include Numbers:**
   - Check the "Number" checkbox to include numeric characters in the password.

3. **Include Special Characters:**
   - Check the "Characters" checkbox to include special characters (!@#$%^&*?<>).

4. **Generate Password:**
   - The password is generated automatically based on the selected criteria.

5. **Copy to Clipboard:**
   - Click the "Copy" button to copy the generated password to the clipboard. An alert will notify you that the password has been copied.
